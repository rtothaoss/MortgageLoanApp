#### Deployed Page: [here](https://desolate-oasis-37454.herokuapp.com/)

The app greets you with a landing page that gives the user the ability to login or use a mortgage calculator. The mortgage calculator auto calculates monthly payment information such as principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and hoa dues. If the user logs in then they are able to see loan information, transaction history, and documents. Documents are viewed in the app through PDFtron. This allows the user to stay on the same page and have a better user experience rather than having it open in a different tab. Users also have the option of uploading documents related to their account.
